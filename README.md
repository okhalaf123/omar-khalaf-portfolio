**Summary:**  
This project analyzes the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and total factor productivity (TFP) across different sectors in India. Using macroeconomic data from the Penn World Table, WDI, and sector-level TFP data from India KLEMS, the analysis explores patterns in productivity growth, sector responsiveness to FDI inflows, and implications for policy. Key outputs include visualizations, regression results, and sector-specific recommendations.

**Key Highlights:**
- Growth accounting framework to understand drivers of GDP growth.
- 5-year moving average comparison between national FDI inflows and sectoral TFP trends.
- Sector-level regression analysis to estimate FDI effects on productivity.
- Policy-oriented recommendations tailored to Indiaâ€™s planning agencies and ministries.
