**Summary:**  
This project analyzes the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and total factor productivity (TFP) across different sectors in India. Using macroeconomic data from the Penn World Table, WDI, and sector-level TFP data from India KLEMS, the analysis explores patterns in productivity growth, sector responsiveness to FDI inflows, and implications for policy. Key outputs include visualizations, regression results, and sector-specific recommendations.

**Key Highlights:**
- Growth accounting framework to understand drivers of GDP growth.
- 5-year moving average comparison between national FDI inflows and sectoral TFP trends.
- Sector-level regression analysis to estimate FDI effects on productivity.
- Policy-oriented recommendations tailored to India’s planning agencies and ministries.

**Tools Used:** R, econometric modeling

## [Review Tone, Product Type, and Rating Variance Study](https://github.com/okhalaf123/sura-online-reviews-experiment)

**Summary:**  
This project tests how review tone, product type, and star rating variance affect consumer purchase intent and product attitude. The 2×2×2 experimental design simulates online product pages and evaluates user responses to hedonic vs. utilitarian products under different review conditions. Outputs include an interactive Tableau dashboard, R-based data cleaning, and business-focused recommendations drawn from statistically significant findings.

**Key Highlights:**

- Post-hoc t-tests comparing hedonic and utilitarian products under matched tone–variance cells.
- Dashboard with filters by tone, product type, and variance, plus dynamic metrics and key takeaways.
- Business recommendations for optimizing review presentation on product pages.

**Tools Used:** R, SPSS, Tableau, experimental design, survey data
